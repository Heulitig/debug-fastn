Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they
in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it
with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which
roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful
Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic
life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem
Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

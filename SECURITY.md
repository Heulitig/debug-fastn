# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are in early development phase of this project, and only support the latest release. We request you to keep updating
`fastn` periodically. `fastn` is backed by [FifthTry](https://fifthtry.com), and we intend to switch to a longer support cycle soon.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report any security vulnerability with `fastn` and any of the related projects, please send a mail to 
`security@fifthtry.com`.
